# Todo

Should maybe make the scripts in this folder a bit more cohesive. Right now there is a sizeable amount of code that is being reused over the various scripts. Refactoring and absstracting could make it easier to modify behaviour in the future.

mdpp is sorta in this weird spaghetti state. The code is not great. I think it might be best to do an almost complete rewrite in potentially rust. If not in Rust then I think at the very least a rewrite in Python is in order.

Move the `note.py` script to a bash script. Right now it is needlessly complicated.
